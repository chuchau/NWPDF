NWPDF
=====

*A fast PDF viewer for iOS.*


About
-----
NWPDF is a Cocoa Touch framework for displaying PDF documents. It is written as alternative to Cocoa's PDF kit, which is not available on iOS. An additional goal was to provide performance and usability comparable to iBooks.

The project consists of three parts: view controllers, page caching utilities, and Objective-C wrapper classes for CGPDF.
